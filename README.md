# Database-Systems
Worked in a group of 7 members to produce a movie review website. Mainly focused on Database functionality. 

Can view pfd files inside milestone folder to read more about the project in detail. 

The whole point of this project was to deeply undertand Database concepts.

Went through the whole Software Development Cycle to produce website. (AGILE, SCRUM, UserCases, Functionality)
